###Problem

119. Pascal's Triangle II 

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


 

Example 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:

Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:

Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]


###CODE

class Solution(object):
    def getRow(self, rowIndex):
        """
        :type rowIndex: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # Initialize the first row
        row = [1]
        
        # Iteratively build the row up to rowIndex
        for i in range(1, rowIndex + 1):
            # Create a new row based on the previous row
            new_row = [1] * (i + 1)
            
            # Fill in the interior values of the row
            for j in range(1, i):
                new_row[j] = row[j - 1] + row[j]
            
            # Update the row to be the newly constructed row
            row = new_row
        
        return row
