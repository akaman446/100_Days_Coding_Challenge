###Problem

83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]


###CODE


class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        current = head

        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next 
            else:
                current = current.next  

        return head
