###
Problem
You are given an integer array 
. Your task is to calculate the sum of absolute difference of indices of first and last occurrence for every integer that is present in array 
.

Formally, if element 
 occurs 
 times in the array at indices 
, then the answer for 
 will be 
 if array 
 is sorted.

You are required to calculate the sum of the answer for every such 
 that occurs in the array.

Refer to sample notes and explanations for better understanding.

Input format

The first line contains an integer 
 that denotes the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 
 that denotes the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains 
 space seperated integers 
.
Output format

For each test case, print a single line as described in the problem statement.
